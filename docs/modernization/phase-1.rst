Phase 1 â€” Packaging and Dependency Overhaul
===========================================

Overview
--------

Phase 1 focuses on modern packaging primitives so the project can build with
current Python toolchains. The guiding principles are:

* publish metadata through ``pyproject.toml`` rather than ``setup.py``;
* raise dependency floors to versions that support Python 3.9+; and
* keep the legacy PyQt5 runtime working until the Qt 6 port lands.

Key changes
-----------

``pyproject.toml`` now drives builds with ``setuptools`` >= 68. The
configuration pulls the version from :mod:`visbrain`, exposes extras that mirror
past ``setup.py`` options, and declares a modern Python range. ``setup.py`` is
retained as a thin shim so existing workflows that call ``python setup.py``
continue to function.

The pinned requirement files were refreshed to align with the metadata. PyQt5
5.15.x remains in place for runtime compatibility, while the optional extras are
ready for the eventual Qt 6 migration. ``MANIFEST.in`` will continue to ship the
resource files consumed at runtime.

Developer workflow
------------------

To build or install from a checkout::

   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   python -m pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
   python -m build

The ``build`` command validates that the ``pyproject.toml`` metadata is
self-consistent and produces an sdist/wheel. Contributors can also install in
editable mode with ``pip install -e .`` when iterating locally.

Next steps
----------

* Convert continuous integration workflows to rely on ``pyproject.toml`` so
  future jobs no longer invoke ``setup.py`` directly.
* Begin extracting Qt-bound logic into dedicated adapters so Phase 2 can add a
  PySide6-backed implementation without breaking PyQt5 users.
* Audit package data requirements and move any implicit resources into explicit
  ``tool.setuptools.package-data`` declarations.
