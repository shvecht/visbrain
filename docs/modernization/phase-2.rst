Phase 2 â€“ Runtime configuration cleanup
=======================================

The second phase of the modernization plan focuses on removing import-time
side effects from :mod:`visbrain.config` and codifying the way GUI resources
are created.  Earlier releases built Qt and VisPy application instances as soon
as the module was imported, which complicated headless automation and made it
hard to reason about global state.  The refactor introduces an explicit
``VisbrainConfig`` facade that keeps track of runtime flags and lazy factories
for GUI backends.

Key changes
-----------

* ``VisbrainConfig`` exposes the active Qt backend, Matplotlib render flag and
  any instantiated GUI handles through attributes instead of the previous
  mutable dictionary.
* ``configure_from_environ`` reads ``VISBRAIN_SHOW_GUI`` so automation can flip
  headless mode via environment variables instead of mutating globals.
* ``ensure_qt_app()`` and ``ensure_vispy_app()`` lazily create GUI
  applications.  Both respect the ``VisbrainConfig.show_pyqt_app`` flag so tests
  run headless by default while still allowing opt-in GUI execution via the
  ``force`` argument.
* ``configure_from_argv(argv, config=...)`` replaces the import-side CLI parser.  The new
  function accepts an explicit argument vector and returns the updated config
  object so entry points can opt in to CLI overrides without polluting module
  import.
* ``parse_cli`` and ``init_config`` remain as thin wrappers around
  ``configure_from_argv`` for legacy consumers and now emit a deprecation
  warning.

Running headless
----------------

Test runners and automation harnesses should continue to set
``QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`` (see :mod:`conftest`) and opt into headless mode
by calling :func:`visbrain.config.configure_headless` or exporting
``VISBRAIN_SHOW_GUI=0``.  The helper only sets a default when the variable is
missing, so local runs can still override it with
``VISBRAIN_SHOW_GUI=1``.  The lazy GUI helpers return ``None`` in headless
mode, so call sites must guard against ``None`` before touching GUI handles.
When a test genuinely needs an application instance it can request it with
``ensure_qt_app(force=True)`` or ``ensure_vispy_app(force=True)``.

CLI integration
---------------

Entry points should no longer rely on :data:`sys.argv` being consumed during
module import.  Instead they should call
``configure_from_argv(sys.argv[1:], config=get_config())`` before bootstrapping
their UI.  The parser now respects all existing flags and
reports invalid ``--visbrain-show`` values without mutating the stored state.
``configure_from_environ`` can be called ahead of CLI parsing so deployment
scripts can respect ``VISBRAIN_SHOW_GUI`` alongside command line overrides.

Enabling interactive launches
-----------------------------

Local runs that should always display the GUI can either export
``VISBRAIN_SHOW_GUI=1`` or pass ``--visbrain-show=True`` to entry points.  Both
mechanisms update :class:`VisbrainConfig` through the same normalization logic,
so automation that sets the environment variable can still be overridden by a
CLI flag when necessary.

Practical examples
------------------

* Tests that previously patched ``CONFIG['SHOW_PYQT_APP']`` now use
  ``get_config().show_pyqt_app``.
* GUI code should request the Qt and VisPy handles via ``ensure_qt_app()`` and
  ``ensure_vispy_app()`` rather than touching module-level globals.  Both
  helpers are safe to call in headless environments.
* Documentation builders can enable Matplotlib rendering explicitly by setting
  ``get_config().mpl_render = True`` in ``docs/conf.py``.

These changes make the runtime state explicit and defer heavyweight resources
until they are genuinely needed, unlocking deterministic behaviour across both
interactive launches and automated tests.
