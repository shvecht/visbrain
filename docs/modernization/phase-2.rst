Phase 2 â€“ Runtime configuration cleanup
=======================================

The second phase of the modernization plan focuses on removing import-time
side effects from :mod:`visbrain.config` and codifying the way GUI resources
are created.  Earlier releases built Qt and VisPy application instances as soon
as the module was imported, which complicated headless automation and made it
hard to reason about global state.  The refactor introduces an explicit
``ConfigManager`` facade that keeps track of runtime flags and lazy factories
for GUI backends.

Key changes
-----------

* ``ConfigManager`` exposes the active Qt backend, Matplotlib render flag and
  any instantiated GUI handles through attributes instead of the previous
  mutable dictionary.
* ``ensure_qt_app()`` and ``ensure_vispy_app()`` lazily create GUI
  applications.  Both respect the ``ConfigManager.show_pyqt_app`` flag so tests
  run headless by default while still allowing opt-in GUI execution via the
  ``force`` argument.
* ``parse_cli(argv, config=...)`` replaces the import-side CLI parser.  The new
  function accepts an explicit argument vector and returns the updated config
  object so entry points can opt in to CLI overrides without polluting module
  import.
* ``init_config`` remains as a thin wrapper around ``parse_cli`` for legacy
  consumers and now emits a deprecation warning.

Running headless
----------------

Test runners and automation harnesses should continue to set
``QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`` (see :mod:`conftest`) and toggle headless mode via
``ConfigManager.show_pyqt_app = False``.  The new helpers will return ``None``
in that configuration, so call sites must guard against ``None`` before
touching GUI handles.  When a test genuinely needs an application instance it
can request it with ``ensure_qt_app(force=True)`` or
``ensure_vispy_app(force=True)``.

CLI integration
---------------

Entry points should no longer rely on :data:`sys.argv` being consumed during
module import.  Instead they should call ``parse_cli(sys.argv[1:], CONFIG)``
before bootstrapping their UI.  The parser now respects all existing flags and
reports invalid ``--visbrain-show`` values without mutating the stored state.

Practical examples
------------------

* Tests that previously patched ``CONFIG['SHOW_PYQT_APP']`` now use
  ``CONFIG.show_pyqt_app``.
* GUI code should request the Qt and VisPy handles via ``ensure_qt_app()`` and
  ``ensure_vispy_app()`` rather than touching module-level globals.  Both
  helpers are safe to call in headless environments.
* Documentation builders can enable Matplotlib rendering explicitly by setting
  ``CONFIG.mpl_render = True`` in ``docs/conf.py``.

These changes make the runtime state explicit and defer heavyweight resources
until they are genuinely needed, unlocking deterministic behaviour across both
interactive launches and automated tests.
